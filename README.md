# textgen

I have borrowed extensively from https://github.com/CodeBoiz/Deep-Learning-Text-Generator/tree/master
So all credits go to the original author.

I have made some changes as the initial instructions were not clear.
The folder GNxx gets generated at runtime so it is something that you will need to change
once it gets generated.
The model file gets stored in the logs folder.

Run the program in this sequence

1. python3 textgen.py train  (This takes around 30mins)

2. python3 textgen.py generate
